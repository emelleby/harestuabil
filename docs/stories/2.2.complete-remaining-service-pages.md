## Dev Notes
### Imagery
Use the Brave search MCP to find relevant imagery to use where needed. Add imagery with links to image.

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.1, we learned:
- ServicePage template component was successfully created with standardized sections
- ServicePageHeader component was implemented with mobile responsiveness
- Service section components (Overview, Benefits, Process, Pricing, FAQs) were created
- DecapCMS integration was updated with service page fields
- Dynamic routing for service pages was implemented at `src/pages/tjenester/[service].tsx`
- All UI text must be in Norwegian Bokmål
- Always use color variables and NEVER hardcode any colors
- Shadcn/UI components were used effectively for consistent design
- Mobile-first responsive design was implemented with Tailwind CSS v4

### Data Models
Service page content will be managed through DecapCMS with the following structure:
- Service name (Norwegian)
- Service description (Norwegian)
- Overview content
- Benefits list
- Process steps
- Pricing information
- FAQ items (question/answer pairs)

### API Specifications
No API endpoints required for this story. Service pages will use static site generation with content from DecapCMS.

### Component Specifications
- Use existing ServicePage template component [Source: docs/stories/2.1.service-page-template.md#135]
- Use existing ServicePageHeader component [Source: docs/stories/2.1.service-page-template.md#136]

- Navigation configuration: `src/config/navigation.ts` [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#254]
- Test files: `src/__tests__/` [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#32]
- Service page template: `src/pages/tjenester/[service].tsx` [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#191]

### Testing Requirements
- Test files location: `src/__tests__/` [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#32]
- Use Jest for unit testing [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#27]
- Test responsive behavior using different viewport sizes [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#177]

### Project Structure Notes
The ServicePage template component and all section components were created in Story 2.1. This story will focus on creating the content for the remaining service pages and updating the navigation to include all service pages. The dynamic routing structure at `src/pages/tjenester/[service].tsx` will automatically handle the new service pages.

### Norwegian Language Implementation
- All UI text must be in Norwegian Bokmål [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#211]
- Service content should use Norwegian terminology [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#211]
- Use Norwegian terminology for service descriptions [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#211]
- Add Norwegian language attribute (lang="nb") to new components [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#387]

## Testing
### Testing Standards
- Test file location: `src/__tests__/` [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#32]
- Use Jest and React Testing Library for component testing [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#27]
- Test responsive behavior using different viewport sizes [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#177]
- Test Norwegian language implementation [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#177]
- Follow naming convention: `*.test.tsx` for test files [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#33]
