## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 3.1, we learned:
- Netlify Forms integration was successfully implemented with Norwegian field labels
- Norwegian brand colors were used consistently throughout the form
- All UI text must be in Norwegian Bokmål
- Shadcn/UI components were used effectively for consistent design
- Mobile-first responsive design was implemented with Tailwind CSS v4
- Form validation with Norwegian error messages was well-received

### Data Models
Contact page will use the following structure:
- Business information: Address, phone, email, opening hours (CMS editable)
- Map location: Latitude, longitude for Google Maps integration
- FAQ items: Question and answer pairs in Norwegian
- Trust indicators: Response time, service area, certifications

### API Specifications
- Google Maps API for location display
- No additional API endpoints required for static content
- Business information will be managed through DecapCMS

### Component Specifications
- Use existing Shadcn/UI components where applicable [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#45]

### Project Structure Notes
The current contact page (`src/pages/kontakt.tsx`) already contains the ContactForm component from Story 3.1. This story will enhance the page by adding additional sections for business information, map, FAQ, and trust indicators. The existing form should remain prominently displayed.

### CMS Integration
- Business information should be editable via DecapCMS [Source: docs/architecture/brownfield-architecture.md#188]
- FAQ items should be manageable through CMS
- Update DecapCMS configuration to include new content fields
- Follow existing CMS patterns used in other pages
