## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.4, we learned:
- Norwegian brand colors were successfully implemented according to the theme colors
- Always use color variables and NEVER hardcode any colors
- All UI text must be in Norwegian Bokmål
- Shadcn/UI components were used effectively for consistent design
- Mobile-first responsive design was implemented with Tailwind CSS v4
- Component integration below existing sections works seamlessly

### Data Models
Service page content will be managed through DecapCMS with the following structure:
- Service name (Norwegian)
- Service description (Norwegian)
- Overview content
- Benefits list
- Process steps
- Pricing information
- FAQ items (question/answer pairs)

### API Specifications
No API endpoints required for this story. Service pages will use static site generation with content from DecapCMS.

### Component Specifications
- Use existing Shadcn/UI components where applicable [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#45]
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS v4 [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#35]
- Use Norwegian brand colors consistent with theme [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#25]
- Implement mobile-first responsive design [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#25]
- Ensure WCAG AA accessibility compliance [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#47]

### File Locations
- ServicePage component: `src/components/ServicePage.tsx` [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#94]
- ServicePageHeader component: `src/components/ServicePageHeader.tsx` [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#94]
- Service section components: `src/components/services/` [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#202]
- Service page template: `src/pages/tjenester/[service].tsx` [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#191]
- DecapCMS config: `public/admin/config.yml` [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#267]
- Test files: `src/__tests__/` [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#32]

### Testing Requirements
- Test files location: `src/__tests__/` [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#32]
- Use Jest for unit testing [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#27]
- Test responsive behavior using different viewport sizes [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#177]
- Minimum coverage thresholds: 80% statements, 75% branches, 85% functions, 80% lines [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#81]

### Technical Constraints
- Maintain existing Shadcn/UI component patterns [Source: docs/architecture/brownfield-architecture.md#203]
- Use Norwegian language throughout (Bokmål) [Source: docs/architecture/brownfield-architecture.md#239]
- Implement mobile-first responsive design [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#25]
- Ensure WCAG AA accessibility compliance [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#47]
- Use Norwegian brand colors: deep blue #1e3a5f, warm brown #8b4513, accent orange #d2691e [Source: docs/epics/epic-1-homepage.md#44]

### Project Structure Notes
The current navigation configuration in `src/config/navigation.ts` needs to be updated to include service pages. The ServicePage component will be a new template that can be reused for all four service types (Verksted, Dekk og felg, Dekkhotell, Bilglass). The dynamic routing structure will allow for easy addition of new services in the future.

### Norwegian Language Implementation
- All UI text must be in Norwegian Bokmål [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#211]
- Service content should use Norwegian terminology [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#211]
- Use Norwegian terminology for service descriptions [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#211]
- Add Norwegian language attribute (lang="nb") to new components [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#387]

## Testing
### Testing Standards
- Test file location: `src/__tests__/ServicePage.test.tsx`, `src/__tests__/ServicePageHeader.test.tsx` [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#32]
- Use Jest and React Testing Library for component testing [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#27]
- Test responsive behavior using different viewport sizes [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#177]
- Test Norwegian language implementation [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#177]
- Follow naming convention: `*.test.tsx` for test files [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#33]
