## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.3, we learned:
- Norwegian brand colors were successfully implemented according to the theme colors
- Always use color variables and NEVER hardcode any colors
- All UI text must be in Norwegian Bokmål
- Shadcn/UI components were used effectively for consistent design
- Mobile-first responsive design was implemented with Tailwind CSS v4
- Lucide React icons were successfully integrated for better visual representation
- Component integration below existing sections works seamlessly

### Data Models
No specific data models required for this story. Navigation and footer will use static content for now.

### API Specifications
No API endpoints required for this story.

### Component Specifications
- Use existing Shadcn/UI components where applicable [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#45]
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS v4 [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#35]
- Use Norwegian brand colors consistent with theme [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#25]
- Implement mobile-first responsive design [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#25]
- Ensure WCAG AA accessibility compliance [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#47]

### File Locations
- Navigation configuration: `src/config/navigation.ts` [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#62]
- Header component: `src/components/Header.tsx` [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#94]
- New Footer component: `src/components/Footer.tsx` [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#94]
- Layout component: `src/components/Layout.tsx` [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#92]
- Test files: `src/__tests__/` [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#32]

### Testing Requirements
- Test files location: `src/__tests__/` [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#32]
- Use Jest for unit testing [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#27]
- Test responsive behavior and mobile menu animations [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#177]
- Minimum coverage thresholds: 80% statements, 75% branches, 85% functions, 80% lines [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#81]

### Technical Constraints
- Maintain existing Shadcn/UI component patterns [Source: docs/architecture/brownfield-architecture.md#203]
- Use Norwegian language throughout (Bokmål) [Source: docs/architecture/brownfield-architecture.md#239]
- Implement mobile-first responsive design [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#25]
- Ensure WCAG AA accessibility compliance [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#47]
- Use Norwegian brand colors: deep blue #1e3a5f, warm brown #8b4513, accent orange #d2691e [Source: docs/epics/epic-1-homepage.md#44]

### Project Structure Notes
The current navigation configuration in `src/config/navigation.ts` contains mixed English and Norwegian labels. This story will standardize all navigation labels to Norwegian Bokmål and enhance the mobile menu experience. The Header component already has a mobile hamburger menu implementation that can be improved with smoother animations. A new Footer component needs to be created and integrated into the Layout component.

### Norwegian Language Implementation
- All navigation labels must be in Norwegian Bokmål [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#211]
- Footer content should use Norwegian business terminology [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#211]
- Use Norwegian terminology for business information [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#211]
- Add Norwegian language attribute (lang="nb") to new components [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#387]

## Testing
### Testing Standards
- Test file location: `src/__tests__/Navigation.test.tsx`, `src/__tests__/Footer.test.tsx` [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#32]
- Use Jest and React Testing Library for component testing [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#27]
- Test responsive behavior using different viewport sizes [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#177]
- Test mobile menu animations and accessibility [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#177]
- Follow naming convention: `*.test.tsx` for test files [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#33]
