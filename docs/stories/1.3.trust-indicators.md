- Mobile-first responsive design was implemented with Tailwind CSS v4
- Lucide React icons were successfully integrated for better visual representation
- Component integration below existing sections works seamlessly

### Data Models
No specific data models required for this story. Testimonials were implemented as static content with TypeScript interfaces for type safety.
