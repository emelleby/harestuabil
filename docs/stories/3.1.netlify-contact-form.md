## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.1, we learned:
- Norwegian brand colors were successfully implemented according to the theme colors
- Always use color variables and NEVER hardcode any colors
- All UI text must be in Norwegian Bokmål
- Shadcn/UI components were used effectively for consistent design
- Mobile-first responsive design was implemented with Tailwind CSS v4

### Data Models
Contact form will use the following structure:
- Navn (Name) - Text input, required
- E-post (Email) - Email input, required
- Telefon (Phone) - Tel input, optional
- Tjeneste type (Service type) - Select dropdown, required
- Melding (Message) - Textarea, required
- Privacy policy acceptance - Checkbox, required
- Honeypot field - Hidden input, for spam protection

### API Specifications
- Netlify Forms API for form submission
- Form data will be submitted to Netlify backend
- No additional API endpoints required

### Component Specifications
- Use existing Shadcn/UI components where applicable [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#45]
- You can find the new 'Field' component here: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/field 
- shadcn components can be added with: 'pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add {{component name}}'
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS v4 [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#35]
- Use Norwegian brand colors consistent with theme [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#25]
- Implement mobile-first responsive design [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#25]
- Ensure WCAG AA accessibility compliance [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#47]

### File Locations
- ContactForm component: `src/components/ContactForm.tsx` [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#94]
- Contact page: `src/pages/kontakt.tsx` [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#190]
- Test files: `src/__tests__/` [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#32]
- Form types: `src/types/contact.ts`

### Testing Requirements
- Test files location: `src/__tests__/` [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#32]
- Use Jest for unit testing [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#27]
- Test form validation and submission [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#177]
- Minimum coverage thresholds: 80% statements, 75% branches, 85% functions, 80% lines [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#81]

### Technical Constraints
- Maintain existing Shadcn/UI component patterns [Source: docs/architecture/brownfield-architecture.md#203]
- Use Norwegian language throughout (Bokmål) [Source: docs/architecture/brownfield-architecture.md#239]
- Implement mobile-first responsive design [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#25]
- Ensure WCAG AA accessibility compliance [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#47]


### Project Structure Notes
The current contact page (`src/pages/kontakt.tsx`) needs to be updated with the new ContactForm component. The form will integrate with Netlify's form handling system, which requires proper HTML form attributes and Netlify-specific configuration.

### Norwegian Language Implementation
- All UI text must be in Norwegian Bokmål [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#211]
- Form field labels: Navn, E-post, Telefon, Melding, Tjeneste type
- Validation messages in Norwegian
- Success/error messages in Norwegian
- Add Norwegian language attribute (lang="nb") to the form component [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#387]

### Netlify Forms Implementation
- Use data-netlify="true" attribute on the form element
- Add hidden input with name="form-name" matching the form name
- Implement proper form encoding type
- Handle form submission with JavaScript for better UX
- Add proper redirect handling after successful submission

## Testing
### Testing Standards
- Test file location: `src/__tests__/ContactForm.test.tsx` [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#32]
- Use Jest and React Testing Library for component testing [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#27]
- Test form validation and submission behavior [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#177]
- Test Norwegian language implementation [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#177]
- Follow naming convention: `*.test.tsx` for test files [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#33]

### Agent Model Used
Claude Sonnet 4 (Augment Agent)

### Debug Log References
No significant debugging required - TDD approach prevented major issues.

### Completion Notes List
Successfully implemented a complete Netlify contact form with Norwegian localization following TDD methodology:

**Key Implementation Details:**
- **TDD Approach**: Started with comprehensive test suite (8 tests) covering all acceptance criteria
- **Norwegian Localization**: All field labels, validation messages, and UI text in Norwegian (Bokmål)
- **Netlify Forms Integration**: Proper form attributes (`data-netlify="true"`, hidden form-name field)
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Client-side validation with Norwegian error messages
- **GDPR Compliance**: Privacy policy checkbox with link to personvernerklæringen
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation support
- **Mobile Optimization**: Responsive design with proper input types (tel, email)
- **Spam Protection**: Honeypot field with proper styling and accessibility attributes
- **State Management**: useReducer for complex form state with loading, success, and error states

**Technical Challenges Solved:**
1. **Radix UI Select Testing**: Fixed multiple element selection issues in tests by using `getAllByText`
2. **Form Validation**: Added `noValidate` to prevent browser validation conflicts with custom validation
3. **ResizeObserver/IntersectionObserver**: Added proper mocks for Radix UI components in test environment
4. **Service Type Integration**: Connected to existing ServiceType enum for consistency

**Test Coverage**: All 8 tests passing, covering:
- Norwegian field rendering
- Service type dropdown functionality
- Form validation with Norwegian messages
- Email format validation
- Form submission with Netlify configuration
- Success/error state handling
- Honeypot spam protection
- Proper form attributes

### File List
**New Files Created:**
- `src/types/contact.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for contact form data and state management
- `src/components/ContactForm.tsx` - Main contact form component with full functionality
- `src/__tests__/ContactForm.test.tsx` - Comprehensive test suite (8 tests)

**Modified Files:**
- `src/pages/kontakt.tsx` - Integrated ContactForm component below existing MDX content
- `src/__tests__/setup.ts` - Added mocks for ResizeObserver, IntersectionObserver, and scrollIntoView

**Dependencies Used:**
- Existing Shadcn/UI components (Button, Input, Textarea, Select, Checkbox, Field, Label)
- React hooks (useReducer for state management)
- Netlify Forms (no additional dependencies required)
