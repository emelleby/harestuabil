## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.2, we learned:
- All service pages have been created with Norwegian content
- Service pages use dynamic routing at `src/pages/tjenester/[service].tsx`
- Service content is managed through MDX files in `content/services/`
- Service pages use the ServicePage template component with standardized sections
- Navigation already includes all service pages
- All service pages use Norwegian language throughout with cultural references

### Data Models
Service page SEO data will be managed through frontmatter in MDX files:
- SEO title (Norwegian)
- SEO description (Norwegian)
- Norwegian keywords
- Structured data markup
- Image alt text (Norwegian)
