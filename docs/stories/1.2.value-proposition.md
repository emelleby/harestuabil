- Norwegian brand colors were successfully implemented: deep blue #1e3a5f, warm brown #8b4513, accent orange #d2691e
- All UI text must be in Norwegian Bokmål
- Shadcn/UI Button component was used effectively for CTAs
- Mobile-first responsive design was implemented with Tailwind CSS v4
- Jest was configured for testing with React Testing Library

### Data Models
No specific data models required for this story.

### API Specifications
No API endpoints required for this story.

### Component Specifications
- Use existing Shadcn/UI components where applicable [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#45]
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS v4 [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#35]
- Use Norwegian brand colors consistent with hero section [Source: docs/epics/epic-1-homepage.md#44]
- Implement hover states and micro-interactions for engagement [Source: docs/epics/epic-1-homepage.md#88]

### File Locations
- Main implementation file: `src/pages/index.tsx` [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#78]
- New component file: `src/components/ValueProposition.tsx` [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#94]
- Test file: `src/__tests__/ValueProposition.test.tsx` [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#32]

### Testing Requirements
- Test files location: `src/__tests__/` [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#32]
- Use Jest for unit testing [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#27]
- Test responsive behavior and micro-interactions [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#177]
- Minimum coverage thresholds: 80% statements, 75% branches, 85% functions, 80% lines [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#81]

### Technical Constraints
- Maintain existing Shadcn/UI component patterns [Source: docs/architecture/brownfield-architecture.md#203]
- Use Norwegian language throughout (Bokmål) [Source: docs/architecture/brownfield-architecture.md#239]
- Implement mobile-first responsive design [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#25]
- Ensure WCAG AA accessibility compliance [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#47]
- Use Norwegian brand colors: deep blue #1e3a5f, warm brown #8b4513, accent orange #d2691e [Source: docs/epics/epic-1-homepage.md#44]

### Project Structure Notes
The current homepage (`src/pages/index.tsx`) already contains the hero section from Story 1.1. This story will add a new value proposition section directly below the hero section. The existing Layout component and meta tags can be reused, but new content needs to be added to showcase the service advantages.

### Norwegian Language Implementation
- All UI text must be in Norwegian Bokmål [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#211]
- Service advantage descriptions should be concise and clear [Source: docs/epics/epic-1-homepage.md#85]
- Use Norwegian terminology for automotive services [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#211]
- Add Norwegian language attribute (lang="nb") to new components [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#387]

## Testing
### Testing Standards
- Test file location: `src/__tests__/ValueProposition.test.tsx` [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#32]
- Use Jest and React Testing Library for component testing [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#27]
- Test responsive behavior using different viewport sizes [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#177]
- Test micro-interactions and hover states [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#177]
- Follow naming convention: `*.test.tsx` for test files [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#33]
