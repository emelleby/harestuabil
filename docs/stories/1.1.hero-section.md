### API Specifications
No API endpoints required for this story.

### Component Specifications
- Use existing Shadcn/UI Button component for CTAs [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#45]
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS v4 [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#35]
- Use Next.js Image component for optimized image loading [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#119]

### File Locations
- Main implementation file: `src/pages/index.tsx` [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#78]
- Navigation configuration: `src/config/navigation.ts` [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#62]
- Header component: `src/components/Header.tsx` [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#94]

### Testing Requirements
- Test files location: `src/__tests__/` [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#32]
- Use Jest for unit testing [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#27]
- Test responsive behavior and accessibility features [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#177]
- Minimum coverage thresholds: 80% statements, 75% branches, 85% functions, 80% lines [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#81]

### Technical Constraints
- Maintain existing Shadcn/UI component patterns [Source: docs/architecture/brownfield-architecture.md#203]
- Use Norwegian language throughout (Bokmål) [Source: docs/architecture/brownfield-architecture.md#239]
- Implement mobile-first responsive design [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#25]

### Project Structure Notes
The current homepage (`src/pages/index.tsx`) is a simple blog-style template that needs complete transformation to a mechanic website hero section. The existing Layout component and meta tags can be reused, but all content needs to be replaced with Norwegian mechanic-specific content.

### Norwegian Language Implementation
- All UI text must be in Norwegian Bokmål [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#211]
- Value proposition text: "Din lokale bilpartner - med god kaffe og personlig service som sparer deg tid, penger og frustrasjoner" [Source: docs/epics/epic-1-homepage.md#51]

- Use Jest and React Testing Library for component testing [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#27]
- Test responsive behavior using different viewport sizes [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#177]
- Test accessibility features with appropriate tools [Source: docs/qa/tdd-strategy.md#177]
