# Project Brief: Local Norwegian Car Mechanic Website
## Executive Summary
A modern, Norwegian-language website positioning a local car mechanic shop as the convenient, personal alternative to big city brand shops. The site will emphasize local advantages through authentic imagery, personal service messaging, and Norwegian hospitality cues including the famous coffee invitation.

Core Value Proposition: "Din lokale bilpartner - med god kaffe og personlig service som sparer deg tid, penger og frustrasjoner"

## Problem Statement
### Current State: Local Norwegian Car Owners Face
- **45+ minute drives** to city brand shops for basic services
- **Higher prices** at corporate brand shops
- **Impersonal service** at large chain operations
- **Time-consuming appointments** and wait times

### Impact
Wasted time, unnecessary expenses, and frustration for routine car maintenance that could be handled locally.

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short
Big city shops don't offer the personal touch, local convenience, or cost savings that neighborhood customers want.

### Urgency
As more local businesses modernize their online presence, this mechanic shop risks losing potential customers who discover services online.

## Proposed Solution

A modern, welcoming website that showcases:

### Local Convenience
*"Ingen lange kjøreturer til byen"*

### Personal Service
Real mechanics, real relationships

### Cost Savings
*"Profesjonell kvalitet uten bypriser"*

### Norwegian Hospitality
The famous coffee invitation

### Core Differentiators
- Hero section featuring actual mechanic in cozy, approachable setting
- Clear messaging about local advantages
- Blog for building trust and showcasing expertise
- Easy contact and service inquiry forms

**High-level Vision**: Become the go-to local resource for car maintenance through digital presence that matches their in-person hospitality.

- **Security/Compliance**: GDPR compliance for contact forms, Norwegian privacy considerations

## Build and Development
### Development Approach
Component-based architecture with reusable UI components

### Content Strategy
DecapCMS configured for Norwegian content editors

### Performance Strategy
Image optimization, code splitting, static generation

## Constraints & Assumptions
### Constraints
- **Budget**: Minimal hosting costs (Netlify free tier sufficient initially)
- **Timeline**: 2-3 weeks for MVP development and content population
- **Resources**: Single developer (AI-assisted), content creation by shop owner
- **Technical**: Must work with DecapCMS for non-technical content updates

### Key Assumptions
- Norwegian car owners respond positively to personal photography and local messaging
- Contact form is sufficient initial conversion method (vs. online booking)
- Mobile usage will be high for local service searches
- Blog content can be regularly maintained by shop staff
- Netlify free tier meets form handling and hosting needs

## Risks & Open Questions
### Key Risks
- **Content Consistency Risk**: Shop owner may struggle with regular blog updates
  - *Mitigation*: Create content calendar and train on DecapCMS
- **Local SEO Risk**: May not appear in local searches initially
  - *Mitigation*: Structured data and local business markup
- **Form Spam Risk**: Netlify forms may attract spam
  - *Mitigation*: Honeypot fields and form validation

### Open Questions
- Specific Norwegian regulatory requirements for business websites?
- Preferred image assets available (mechanic photos, workshop shots)?
- Exact business location and contact information for structured data?
- Desired blog post frequency and content focus areas?

## Areas Needing Further Research
- Norwegian business website compliance requirements
- Local SEO best practices for Norwegian markets
- Optimal form fields for Norwegian car service inquiries
