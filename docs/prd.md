# Local Norwegian Car Mechanic Website - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Increase local customer acquisition by 30% within 6 months
- Establish as preferred local mechanic through modern digital presence  
- Reduce customer inquiries about driving to city competitors
- Build trust through authentic Norwegian hospitality and expertise

### Background Context
This project addresses the significant inconvenience local Norwegian car owners face when forced to drive 45+ minutes to city brand shops for basic services. The current market gap presents an opportunity to position this local mechanic as the convenient, cost-effective alternative that embodies Norwegian values of practicality (*praktisk*), reliability (*pålitelig*), and community (*lokalsamfunn*). The website will serve as the digital embodiment of their in-person hospitality, featuring authentic local imagery and the famous Norwegian coffee invitation.
